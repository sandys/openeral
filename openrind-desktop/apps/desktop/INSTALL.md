# Installing Openrind Desktop with OpenShell sandboxing

This is the install + first-run guide for the OpenShell-enabled fork of
Openrind Desktop. If you're a banker following an IT-provided MSI, start at
**Step 1 — install**. If you're IT preparing a fleet deployment, jump to
**For IT: deployment notes** at the bottom.

## What you'll get

After install, every new agent session you start can run inside an
NVIDIA OpenShell sandbox — an isolated Docker container with the policy your
firm picked. The agent has its own filesystem, no access to your laptop's
network outside the firm-allowlisted endpoints, and resource caps so a
runaway prompt can't take your laptop down.

You still get the same Openrind Desktop chat UI; the sandbox is invisible until
something tries to do something the policy disallows, at which point
you'll see an approval prompt.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 (build 22000 or later)
- 16 GB RAM minimum
- 30 GB free disk space
- Admin rights for the **first launch only** (to install WSL2)
- BitLocker recovery key handy (you may be prompted after the first
  reboot — see **What if** below)

Openrind Desktop ships everything else — the WSL2 distro, Docker Engine, the
OpenShell CLI, and the default banking policy bundle — all bundled in
the installer. No Microsoft Store. No corporate-proxy worries during
setup.

---

## Step 1 — install

1. Double-click the installer your IT delivered:
   `openrind-desktop-windows-x64-<version>.exe`
2. If Windows SmartScreen warns about an unrecognized publisher,
   ask IT — the signed build should pass. Don't bypass the warning on
   your own.
3. Accept the install location (defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Openrind Desktop`).
4. Launch Openrind Desktop. **Don't** close the window if it looks busy on
   first launch — see Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — first-run sandbox setup

The first time you launch, Openrind Desktop detects that OpenShell isn't
installed yet and walks you through a one-time setup wizard.

The wizard runs **six steps**. Each one tells you what it's doing:

1. **Preflight** — checks Windows version, free disk, Hyper-V state.
   Instant.
2. **WSL2** — installs Windows Subsystem for Linux. **You'll see a UAC
   prompt here.** Click Yes. **Windows will then ask you to reboot.**
   Close Openrind Desktop, reboot, and launch Openrind Desktop again — the wizard
   resumes automatically. ~5 minutes including the reboot.
3. **Distro** — imports the Ubuntu image that comes bundled with the
   installer. ~2 minutes, no network needed.
4. **Docker** — installs Docker Engine inside the distro. ~3 minutes,
   no network needed (Docker packages are pre-baked into the image).
5. **OpenShell** — verifies the matched patched CLI/gateway/supervisor trio and
   starts the paired FUSE gateway system service. ~2 minutes.
6. **Verify** — runs the Doctor end-to-end. When all components are
   green, setup is done.

After Verify completes, **Settings → Sandbox** shows green for every
component and you're ready to create your first sandboxed workspace.

## What if

### "Your laptop is asking for a BitLocker recovery key after the reboot"

Windows sometimes requires re-authentication after Hyper-V is enabled.
Your IT department has the recovery key for your laptop.

**Don't guess.** Multiple wrong attempts can lock you out. Open a help-
desk ticket *before* clicking continue on the BitLocker screen if you
don't have the key.

### "Windows says virtualization isn't enabled"

Hyper-V depends on a BIOS setting (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). Your IT
department needs to flip it during a maintenance window — it requires
booting into firmware setup, which can't be done remotely.

Send IT a ticket with this text:

> Hi — I need virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) enabled in the BIOS
> on my laptop so I can run Openrind Desktop's OpenShell sandbox. The
> "Virtual Machine Platform" Windows optional feature shows as Disabled
> (this is the WSL2 prerequisite, not the full Hyper-V role). Could we
> schedule a 10-minute maintenance window to enable it?

### "wsl --install fails with a policy error"

Your firm's group policy may block `wsl --install`. Openrind Desktop's
installer surfaces the exact error message from Windows — copy that
text and email it to IT along with this:

> Hi — Openrind Desktop failed to install WSL2 on my laptop:
>
>     <paste error here>
>
> Could we get the
> `Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows
> Components → Windows Subsystem for Linux` GPO updated to allow it?

### "EDR (CrowdStrike / SentinelOne) keeps killing the installer"

Openrind Desktop spawns `wsl.exe` and `docker` repeatedly during setup. Some
EDR profiles treat repeated subprocess spawning as suspicious. Open the
Doctor (Settings → Sandbox → Refresh) and watch for "wsl.exe processes
are being terminated by another program" — if you see it, ask IT to
allowlist:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Openrind Desktop\Openrind Desktop.exe`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\openrind-desktop\distro\ext4.vhdx`
- The `wsl.exe` parent process

### "First run says I'm out of disk space"

The installer needs ~10 GB free during setup; the steady-state
distro+sandbox usage is ~5 GB. Doctor checks `/` inside the distro for
free space and toasts you when you drop below 10%. If that happens:

1. Settings → Sandbox → Reset OpenShell distro (wipes + re-imports the
   bundled rootfs — preserves your workspaces in Openrind Desktop's local
   storage, but loses any state inside the distro)
2. Run `wsl --shrink openrind-desktop-openshell` to compact the virtual disk

### "My session won't start — Doctor says gateway: missing"

Settings → Sandbox → **Restart gateway**. Openrind Desktop owns a paired
system service named `openrind-desktop-fuse-gateway.service` and starts it
automatically. The restart action targets that exact service and the patched
CLI/gateway/supervisor trio; users do not run a separate gateway command.

## Claude Code (Openrind Shell) workspaces

Openrind Desktop runs Claude Code in the primary OpenShell FUSE sandbox, with
the complete `/sandbox/work` tree backed by PostgreSQL and restored across
container recreation and machines. Pick **Openrind Shell — Claude Code** when
creating a sandbox; the session opens in the embedded terminal.

What you need first:

- A reachable `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase, Neon, or firm-internal Postgres)
- An Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-...`)
- The bundled OpenShell stack installed (Settings → Sandbox → green)

Configure both credentials in **Settings → Environment**. Values are encrypted
by the OS keyring and never returned to the renderer once saved. The database
URL is a one-time mode-0600 initialization upload; the Anthropic key is owned by
the OpenShell `claude` provider.

The first launch may need to download the published FUSE image. Warm launches
reuse the Ready sandbox and connect directly. The progress card shows the real
control-plane, image, provider, initialization, and terminal activity.

Full walkthrough + troubleshooting: [`OPENRIND_SHELL.md`](./OPENRIND_SHELL.md).

## For IT: deployment notes

### Default policy

Openrind Desktop ships **`banking-strict.yaml`** as the default policy. It:

- Allows egress only to `api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, and
  `REPLACE.*.internal.bank.invalid` placeholders you need to fill in
- Hard-denies SMB/SSH/NetBIOS ports + public DNS (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8,
  9.9.9.9)
- Limits each sandbox to 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM / 10 GB disk
- Requires approval for any HTTP request to a non-allowlisted host

See `apps/orchestrator/policies/README.md` for the authoring guide and
the schema fields.

### Replacing placeholders

The shipped `banking-strict.yaml` has `REPLACE.*.internal.bank.invalid`
entries that need to be edited to point at your firm's internal hosts.
Two ways to ship the override:

1. **Per-laptop file drop:** copy your firm-specific YAML to
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\openrind-desktop\openshell-policies\firm-strict.yaml` via
   SCCM/Intune. Then deliver a deployment profile that sets
   `defaultPolicy: firm-strict.yaml`.
2. **In-place edit:** modify the file shipped with the installer at
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Openrind Desktop\resources\openshell-policies\banking-strict.yaml`.
   Less ideal — the next auto-update replaces it.

### Sandbox health Doctor

The Doctor is the single source of truth for "is OpenShell working?".
For triage, ask the user to:

1. Open Settings → Sandbox
2. Click Refresh (top right)
3. Screenshot the component checklist + paste the install activity log

The component IDs map 1:1 to the failure-mode table in the spec — IT
diagnostics teams already know what `docker: missing` vs.
`openshell-cli: warn` mean.

### Telemetry

Openrind Desktop does not phone home about sandbox health by default. If you
need structured failure-mode reporting for your fleet, the Doctor's
output is JSON-serializable and can be picked up by your monitoring
agent from the IPC channel `openshellDoctor`. The plumbing for opt-in
fleet telemetry is a separate spec (intentionally — banker-product
telemetry has compliance requirements that vary firm to firm).
