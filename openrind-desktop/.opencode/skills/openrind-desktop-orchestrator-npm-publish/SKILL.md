## Quick usage (already configured)

1. Ensure you are on the default branch and the tree is clean.
2. Bump versions via the shared release bump (this keeps `openrind-desktop-orchestrator` aligned with the app/desktop release).

```bash
pnpm bump:patch
# or: pnpm bump:minor
# or: pnpm bump:major
# or: pnpm bump:set -- X.Y.Z
```

3. Commit the bump.
4. Preferred: publish via the "Release App" GitHub Actions workflow by tagging `vX.Y.Z`.

Manual recovery path (sidecars + npm) below.

```bash
pnpm --filter openrind-desktop-orchestrator build:sidecars
gh release create openrind-desktop-orchestrator-vX.Y.Z packages/orchestrator/dist/sidecars/* \
  --repo different-ai/openwork \
  --title "openrind-desktop-orchestrator vX.Y.Z sidecars" \
  --notes "Sidecar binaries and manifest for openrind-desktop-orchestrator vX.Y.Z"
```

5. Build openrind-desktop-orchestrator binaries for all supported platforms.

```bash
pnpm --filter openrind-desktop-orchestrator build:bin:all
```

6. Publish `openrind-desktop-orchestrator` as a meta package + platform packages (optionalDependencies).
